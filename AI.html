            <h2 class="topic-title">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p class="general-text">In the simplest terms, AI which stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems
                or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based
                on the information they collect. AI manifests in a number of forms. A few examples are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="general-text">Chatbots use AI to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient
                    answers</li>
                <li class="general-text">Intelligent assistants use AI to parse critical information from large free-text
                    datasets to improve scheduling</li>
                <li class="general-text">Recommendation engines can provide automated recommendations for TV shows based
                    on users’ viewing habits</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="general-text">AI is much more about the process and the capability for superpowered thinking and
                data analysis than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of
                high-functioning, human-like robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s
                intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions. That makes it a very valuable
                business asset.</p>
            <h2 class="topic-title">AI and developers</h2>
            <p class="general-text">Developers use artificial intelligence to more efficiently perform tasks that are
                otherwise done manually, connect with customers, identify patterns, and solve problems. To get started
                with AI, developers should have a background in mathematics and feel comfortable with algorithms.
                When getting started with using artificial intelligence to build an application, it helps to start
                small. By building a relatively simple project, such as tic-tac-toe, for example, you’ll learn the
                basics of artificial intelligence. Learning by doing is a great way to level-up any skill, and
                artificial intelligence is no different. Once you’ve successfully completed one or more small-scale
                projects, there are no limits for where artificial intelligence can take you.</p>
            <h2 class="topic-title">How AI Technology can help organizations</h2>
            <p class="general-text">AI technology is improving enterprise performance and productivity by automating
                processes or tasks that once required human power. AI can also make sense of data on a scale that no
                human ever could. That capability can return substantial business benefits. For example, Netflix uses
                machine learning to provide a level of personalization that helped the company grow its customer base by
                more than 25 percent in 2017.
                Most companies have made data science a priority and are investing in it heavily. In Gartner's recent
                survey of more than 3,000 CIOs, respondents ranked analytics and business intelligence as the top
                differentiating technology for their organizations. The CIOs surveyed see these technologies as the most
                strategic for their companies; therefore, they are attracting the most new investment.
                AI has value for most every function, business, and industry. It includes general and industry-specific
                applications such as:

                    <h3 class="image-title">• Online shopping and advertising</h3>
                    <p class="general-text">Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalised recommendations
                        to people, based for example on their previous searches and purchases or other online behaviour.
                        AI is hugely important in commerce: optimising products, planning inventory, logistics etc.</p>

                    <p class="general-text">Smartphones use AI to provide services that are as relevant and personalised
                        as possible. Virtual assistants answering questions, providing recommendations and helping
                        organise daily routines have become ubiquitous.</p>

                    <p class="general-text">Language translation software, either based on written or spoken text, relies
                        on artificial intelligence to provide and improve translations. This also applies to functions
                        such as automated subtitling.</p>

                    <p class="general-text">Researchers are studying how to use AI to analyse large quantities of health
                        data and discover patterns that could lead to new discoveries in medicine and ways to improve
                        individual diagnostics.
                        For example, researchers developed an AI program for answering emergency calls that promises to
                        recognise a cardiac arrest during the call faster and more frequently than medical dispatchers.

                        elsewhere. In medicine it can help recognise infection from computerised tomography lung scans.
                        It has also been used to provide data to track the spread of the disease.</p>
