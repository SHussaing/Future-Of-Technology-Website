            <h2 class="topic-title">What is Virtual Reality?</h2>
            <p class="general-text">Virtual reality is a simulated 3D environment that enables users to explore and
                interact with a virtual surrounding in a way that approximates reality, as it is perceived through the
                users' senses. The environment is created with computer hardware and software, although users might also
                need to wear devices such as helmets or goggles to interact with the environment. The more deeply users
                can immerse themselves in a VR environment -- and block out their physical surroundings -- the more they
                are able to suspend their belief and accept it as real, even if it is fantastical in nature.</p>
            <h2 class="topic-title">What are the main types of Virtual Reality?</h2>
            <p class="general-text">The VR industry still has far to go before realizing its vision of a totally immersive
                environment that enables users to engage multiple sensations in a way that approximates reality.
                However, the technology has come a long way in providing realistic sensory engagement and shows promise
                for business use in a number of industries.<br>
                VR systems can vary significantly from one to the next, depending on their purpose and the technology
                used, although they generally fall into one of the following three categories:
            </p>

            <p class="general-text"><span class="blue-text"> • Non-immersive. </span> This type of VR typically refers to
                a 3D simulated environment that's accessed through a computer screen. The environment might also
                generate sound, depending on the program. The user has some control over the virtual environment using a
                keyboard, mouse or other device, but the environment does not directly interact with the user. A video
                game is a good example of non-immersive VR, as is a website that enables a user to design a room's
                decor.</p>
            <p class="general-text"><span class="blue-text"> • Semi-immersive. </span>This type of VR offers a partial
                virtual experience that's accessed through a computer screen or some type of glasses or headset. It
                focuses primarily on the visual 3D aspect of virtual reality and does not incorporate physical movement
                in the way that full immersion does. A common example of semi-immersive VR is the flight simulator,
                which is used by airlines and militaries to train their pilots. </p>
            <p class="general-text"><span class="blue-text"> • Fully immersive </span> This type of VR delivers the
                greatest level of virtual reality, completely immersing the user in the simulated 3D world. It
                incorporates sight, sound and, in some cases, touch. There have even been some experiments with the
                addition of smell. Users wear special equipment such as helmets, goggles or gloves and are able to fully
                interact with the environment. The environment might also incorporate such equipment as treadmills or
                stationary bicycles to provide users with the experience of moving through the 3D space. Fully immersive
                VR technology is a field still in its infancy, but it has made important inroads into the gaming
                industry and to some extent the healthcare industry, and it's generating a great deal of interest in
                others. </p>

                    <h3 class="image-title">• Training</h3>
                    <p class="general-text">VR makes it possible to train personnel safely, efficiently and
                        cost-effectively. It can be especially beneficial to those in high-risk or highly specialized
                        positions, such as firefighters, EMTs, police officers, soldiers, surgeons or other medical
                        personnel.</p>

                    <h3 class="image-title"> • Education</h3>
                    <p class="general-text">VR offers educational institutions new methods for teaching and learning. It
                        can provide students with intimate insights into environments that are typically inaccessible,
                        while keeping them engaged in the learning process. For example, a history teacher might use VR
                        to show students firsthand what life was like in ancient Greece or China.</p>

                    <h3 class="image-title"> • Healthcare</h3>
                    <p class="general-text">VR has the potential to benefit individuals across the healthcare industry,
                        including patients, practitioners and researchers. For example, VR shows promise in treating
                        disorders such as anorexia, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On the other hand,
                        doctors might be able to use VR when working with the patients to explain diagnoses or treatment
                        options. VR could also benefit individuals who are physically limited in some way.</p>

                    <h3 class="image-title"> • Retail</h3>
                    <p class="general-text">VR has already made some inroads into retail, but the industry has only
                        scratched the surface. With the right apps, customers will be able to try on clothes, decorate
                        their homes, experiment with hair styles, test eye glasses and in general make more informed
                        decisions about products and services.</p>

                    <h3 class="image-title"> • Real estate</h3>
                    <p class="general-text">VR can benefit real estate in a number of ways. For example, architects can
                        show detailed plans in 3D; home buyers can tour homes virtually; building engineers can tour
                        HVAC systems; and home owners can see what their remodels would look like.</p>

                    <h3 class="image-title"> • Entertainment</h3>
                    <p class="general-text">VR has already had an impact on gaming, but it also promises to transform the
                        film and television industries, providing viewers with an immersive experience that puts them
                        right into the scene. VR could also lead to an entire industry in virtual tourism, making it
                        possible for people to experience places that they might never be able to see in-person.</p>
