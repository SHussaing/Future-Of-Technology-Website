            <h2 class="topic-title">What are Robots?</h2>
            <p class="general-text">The term "Robots" differs from person to a person, in fact even Roboticist have
                different notions and definitions for what is considered as a Robot and what is not considered as a
                Robot. Robots can range from a huge sized one in factories to robots with the size of a coin to help in
                surgeons, this diversity in size, design, capabilities made it hard to come up with a world-wide agreed
                definition. In addition to that, science fiction has strongly influenced our ideas and thoughts about
                what Robots are and what they do. A simple division is <q
                    cite="https://robots.ieee.org/learn/what-is-a-robot/"><i>A robot is an autonomous machine capable of
                        sensing its environment, carrying out computations to make decisions, and performing actions in
                        the real world.</i></q> </p>
            <h2 class="topic-title">Difference between Robots and AI</h2>
            <p class="general-text">
                Robots and AI are somehow similar fields, yet they have many differences.
                <a id="intext-links" href="AI.html">AI </a>is when system simulate and emulate the human mind to learn and
                evolve, solve problems, and take decisions, without needing to be explicitly programmed.
                While Robots are usually designed, built, programmed to do a specific, repetitive task that does not
                change and does not require any thinking. However, Robots and AI can coexist by making artificial
                intelligent robots that can think and make decisions on their own, rather than inartificial robots. This
                is still being developed, artificial robots are currently the minor, but in future most robots will be
                artificial intelligent.
            </p>
            <h2 class="topic-title">Robots in the future</h2>
            <p class="general-text">
                "Robots will Replace humans in the future."
                This is probably is the main reason why robots is a controversial topic, because its effects is still
                somehow vague and not clear. Because its effects will benefit certain kind of people and will cause a
                lot of harm to others.
                Although it is hard to quantify them, studies and estimates shows that by 2025, Robots and automation
                brought by them will destroy around 85 million jobs. However, they estimates that it will create around
                97 million new jobs with a difference of 12 million job.
                Another study expects that by 2030, in the USA, up to 73 million jobs, 46% of current jobs, will be
                automated, so it will make a huge difference in the job market. Currently, we are already experiencing
                some of these implications.
                Another important consideration that can threaten the advancement is the security, because every
                internet-connected device is an opportunity for hackers to reach in, and take control of the robot.

                    <p class="general-text">
                        One of the most fields that robots have affected positively is the medical field. Robots can
                        help doctors in performing operations more precisely and in small and tight areas.
                        Additionally, there are robots that act as a exoskeleton that provide additional support for
                        people that are under rehabilitation after injures or surgeons.
                        Popular example is The da Vinci Surgical Robot and The CyberKnife.

                        Robots in Military can be used in a variety of ways. The can be used as unmanned drones to keep
                        surveillance on the enemy in the war area.
                        Also, it can be used as a armed systems to attack the enemies. Moreover, it can have a ground
                        system detection to find improvised explosive devices.
                        Finally, it can be used as an assistants for troops to carry have gear. Examples are: Endeavor
                        Robotics' PackBot, MAARS and DOGO.

                        For astronauts, there are many things that are considered dangerous to do. For example,
                        they can not roam on Mars or other planets to collect soil samples or taking pictures of
                        specific formations there,
                        and they certainly can not repair a spaceship from outside while they are flying in space.
                        Examples are:
                        Mars rovers that are on Mars and take pictures there for scientists to study, and Nasa's
                        Robonaut the humaniod that flew to the International Space Station and currently is on Earth.

                        Robots can reach and go to places where humans nor regular machines can reach, the depths of
                        ocean.
                        There is a lot of pressure there in the deep which humans can not handle and submarines can go
                        only to a certain depth.
                        Scientists have developed specially designed robots that can handle the pressure there, they are
                        remote controlled to take images of the life there.
                        Examples are: Aquanaut, ACM-R5H snakebot, and humaniods such as Ocean One.

                        There are so many repetitive and monotonous tasks in the manufacturing industry and factories.
                        These tasks usually doesn't require any thinking such as:
                        packing, assembling, welding, and transferring item from one storage to another. That's why
                        companies like Amazon started to use Robots in their warehouses to do these things
                        leaving the challenging and creative tasks to human. Additionally, companies argue that by using
                        these Robots they are saving some money because Robots do not get salaries.
